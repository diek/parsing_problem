## Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Requirements

 1. Print the total (rate-adjusted) transactional value of each account.
note: to calculate the rate adjusted value of a given transaction, find the rate that was effective on the transaction's book_date and multiply the rate's multiplier by the transaction's value.

2. Find every out of sequence transaction per account.
note: a transaction is out of sequence if its book date is earlier than any preceding transaction when ordered by sequence number

3. Construct a new transaction list where the out-of-sequence transactions are corrected.
